	; it is considered as a "data" by the processor. This offset (the memory address of "hello_string") will be added to the data segment
	; selector which resides in the register "ds". According to "Protected Mode Software Architecture", the initial value of "ds" is 0000h,
	; so, if we keep "ds" as it is, the CPU is going to load the data from the memory 00001000, BUT we are actually on 07C0, so the data
	; segment selector should be 07C0h so we can get the correct address of "hello_string" which is 07C01000 and not 00001000.
